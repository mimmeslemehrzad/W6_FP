      <strong>Greek yogurt</strong> is a yogurt that has been strained to remove
      most of its whey, resulting in a thicker consistency than unstrained
      yogurt, while preserving yogurt's distinctive sour taste. Like many types
      of yogurt, strained yogurt is often made from milk that has been enriched
      by boiling off some of its water content, or by adding extra butterfat and
      powdered milk. In Europe and North America, it is often made with low-fat
      or fat-free yogurt. In Iceland a similar product named <em>skyr</em> is
      produced.
